Welcome to the AWS Cost Predictor! üòé This GitHub Action is your crystal ball üîÆ for AWS deployment costs. It's like peeking into the future of your AWS expenses before hitting that deploy button. Cool, right? üåü

## What Does It Do?

The AWS Cost Predictor is your pre-deployment buddy, giving you a cost report for major resources like EC2, RDS, EKS, AutoScalingGroup, and EBS volumes. It checks out your Infrastructure as Code (IAC) and generates a detailed cost report before deploying. No surprises when it comes to your AWS bill! 

## How Does It Work?

It will query your IAC code. Just pass down the IAC path in your repo, and voil√†! It generates a cost report for your deployment before it's actually deployed. It's the pre-deployment view of your cost. And currently, it supports IAC code of Terraform. üåê
